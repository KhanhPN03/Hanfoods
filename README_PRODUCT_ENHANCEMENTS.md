# CocoNature Platform Enhancements

## Product Model Changes

### Product Schema
The Product model has been enhanced to include:

- `thumbnailImage`: A main image used for listings, cart, and wishlist displays
- `images`: An array of image URLs for the product gallery in detail views
- `rating`: Product rating from 0-5 (default: 4.5)
- `reviewCount`: Number of reviews (default: 0)
- `materials`: Description of product materials
- `dimensions`: Product dimensions information

### Wishlist Schema
The Wishlist model has been restructured to:

- Use one wishlist per user (enforced by unique userId constraint)
- Store an array of product IDs instead of individual wishlist items
- Provide more efficient storage and faster queries

## Frontend Changes

The front-end has been updated to:

1. **Product Cards**
   - Use `thumbnailImage` for display
   - Properly handle cases when images are missing

2. **Product Gallery**
   - Display all images from the product's `images` array
   - Allow clicking through images in the gallery
   - Default to `thumbnailImage` if no other images exist

3. **Product Validation**
   - Enhanced validation HOC to ensure consistent product display
   - Added support for the new image fields

## Migration

A migration script has been provided to:

1. Update existing products to the new schema
2. Add sample categories and products with high-quality images
3. Ensure backward compatibility

Run the migration with:
```bash
cd /path/to/backend
node scripts/migrate-products.js
```

## Sample Data

The system now includes sample data for coconut products with realistic:
- Images (from real coconut products)
- Descriptions
- Prices
- Categories
- Ratings and reviews

## API Improvements

- The product API now returns more detailed product information
- Wishlist API returns a single wishlist with all products instead of multiple wishlist items
- Better error handling for missing images or product information
